# Sonar Ruby Plugin

This plugin adds support for projects written in Ruby to be analyzed by Sonar.

Currently only captures very basic metrics (LOC, Comment %).

### Plans include:
* Allowing drill-down into source files
* Code highlighting
* Parsing RCov reports for test coverage metrics
* Parsing Flog reports for complexity score metrics
