# Sonar Ruby Plugin

This plugin adds support for projects written in Ruby to be analyzed by Sonar.

Currently only captures very basic metrics (LOC, Comment %, Overall Coverage %).
Source code displays with simple code highlighting.

### Plans include:
* Parsing RCov reports for detailed test coverage metrics
* Parsing Flog reports for complexity score metrics
